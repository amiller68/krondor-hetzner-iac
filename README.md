# Krondor IaC

I am creating this repository to collect the scripts and playbooks that I find myself running over and over again, and hate doing by hand.
It's a supreme over indulgence in automating anything I can think of (and trying to get better at ans).
Hopefully I can use it as a template for one off projects when I might want to implement a subset of the tools described here.

It  primarily is concerned with adminstering provisioned servers and hardware. I like using Hetzner dedicated machines.
If you want E2E automation of provisioning this repository is not (yet) for you

Scripts assume Ubuntu 22.04 LTS environment at the moment, that's just my go to.

## Dependencies
- Python
- Ansible
