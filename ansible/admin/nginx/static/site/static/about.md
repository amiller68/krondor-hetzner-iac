# Who?

My name is Al Miller. I'm a born-and-raised New Yorker, tech enthusiast, creative, and all around curious person. Since college I've been working in tech and thinking about the relationship between knowledge, power, and technology. I hope to continue to explore these ideas and share my thoughts here.

# What?
My main gig and interests right now lie in Software Engineering. Currently I'm working at [Banyan](https://banyan.computer) helping make decentralized, redundant, and private file storage available to everyone as a Founding Team Member and Software Engineer.

In my free time I like to write, make music, and create software like the very site you're reading this on.

# Where?

I'm currently living in New York City, NY, USA. I'm always interested in meeting like minded people, so if you're in the area and want to chat, feel free to reach out.

# When?

Uh, now, duh lol :p

# Why?

Oh that's a hard one. I guess I'm always striving to unify my work and passions into a cohesive whole. This site is part of that effort! I just want to build tools that are helpful, make things that people enjoy, and live a life that I can be satisfied with.

# Why ... Krondor?

"Krondor" is a refernece to an MTV show that I got into during the summer after High School. I bought this domain and the moniker has stuck with me ever since.
